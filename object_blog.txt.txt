Objects and Their Internal Representation in JavaScript:
=========================================================
JavaScript, as a versatile and widely used programming language, relies heavily on objects. Objects serve as the building blocks for modern JavaScript applications,
allowing developers to create complex data structures and organize related data. In this blog, we’ll explore what objects are, their internal representation, and how they differ from primitive data types.

Understanding Objects
======================
1.What Are Objects?
-------------------
In JavaScript, an object is a reference data type.
Unlike primitive data types (such as numbers, strings, and booleans), which store a single value each, objects can hold a combination of primitive data types and reference data types.
Objects are unordered collections of related data, represented as “key: value” pairs.
Keys (also known as properties) can be variables or functions, while values can be any data type.

2.Creating Objects
------------------
You can create an object using either the new Object() constructor or object literal notation ({}).
For example:
JavaScript

// Using object literal notation
const myCar = {
  make: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  year: 1969
};

3.Properties and Methods
----------------------
An object has properties associated with it.
Properties are essentially variables attached to the object.
You can access properties using dot notation (objectName.propertyName) or bracket notation (objectName['propertyName']).
Example:
JavaScript

console.log(myCar.make); // Output: Ford

4.Internal Representation of Objects
-------------------------------------
Internally, objects are stored as a collection of key-value pairs.
Each key (property name) maps to a value (either data or references to functions).
When you access an object’s property or method, JavaScript searches for the property name in the object’s internal collection of key-value pairs.


Key Concepts
==============
1.Data Properties vs. Accessor Properties
-------------------------------------------
Objects have two types of properties:
Data properties: Contain a value (e.g., myCar.make).
Accessor properties: Contain getter and setter functions (e.g., myCar.getColor()).
These properties define the characteristics of the object.

2.Header Compression
--------------------
HTTP/2 uses header compression (HPACK) to optimize the representation of object properties.
Header fields are encoded and transmitted efficiently, reducing overhead.

3.Server Push
--------------
HTTP/2 introduces server push, allowing the server to proactively send additional resources to the client.
For example, pushing CSS files or images that the client will likely need.

Conclusion
===========
Understanding how objects are internally represented in JavaScript is essential for efficient coding and optimizing performance. Objects provide a powerful way to organize and manipulate data, making them a fundamental part of modern web development.

Remember that objects are not just data containers; they encapsulate behavior (methods) as well. As you continue your JavaScript journey, explore objects further and leverage their flexibility to build robust applications.

In summary, objects in JavaScript are versatile data structures that store related data as key-value pairs. Their internal representation involves efficient storage and retrieval of properties. By mastering objects, you’ll unlock the full potential of JavaScript development.
